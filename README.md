About the Project

LifeLink is a web platform designed to close the gap between people who need blood or organs and the donors who can provide them — matched fast, fairly, and within the same city, since organs and blood have an extremely short viable transport window.

Individuals can register as donors (living blood donors or post-mortem organ pledgers), and hospitals can raise emergency requests that are instantly matched against an explainable scoring engine, dispatched to the best-fit donor, tracked through simulated logistics, and permanently logged with a cryptographic verification hash.

This project was built for a hackathon and is now open for community contributions to grow it into a production-ready system.

Problem Statement

Organs and blood have an extremely short viable transport window, so allocation has to happen fast, fairly, and within the same city. Today:

Individuals who need an organ often don't know where or how to find one.
Hospitals in an emergency have no fast, transparent way to locate and reach eligible donors.
Existing donor registries are often static lists with no real-time matching or accountability.

LifeLink solves this with an instant, explainable matching engine for hospitals and a simple, engaging registration experience for individuals.

Key Features
🧍 Individual registration — sign up as a donor, pledge organs for post-mortem donation, and register as a living blood donor
🏥 Hospital emergency requests — create urgent requests for a specific blood type or organ
⚡ Matching Engine — live, explainable scoring of eligible donors on compatibility, proximity, and urgency
📲 Emergency Dispatch (simulated) — top-ranked donor alerted via a simulated WhatsApp/SMS message, with automatic fallback to the next donor
🚑 Live Logistics View — auto-generated route with an animated transport vehicle and simulated temperature telemetry
🔐 Transparency Log — every allocation recorded with a SHA-256 verification hash to prove priority-based, not favoritism-based, allocation
🤖 AI Recommendations — rule-based insight cards for donors (tier progress, high-demand blood types) and hospitals (seasonal demand trends)
📊 Reports Page — charts covering donations over time, fulfillment rate, and city-wise donor distribution
🗺️ Nearby Hospital Search — Google Maps-based lookup for cross-hospital transfer requests when local supply is short
🏆 Gamification — donor levels, unlockable badges, and a city leaderboard to drive repeat donations

Core Workflow

<details> <summary><strong>▸ Click to expand the full step-by-step workflow</strong></summary>
Hospital Request — Hospital logs in and creates an urgent request (e.g. O- blood or a kidney match).
Matching Engine — All eligible donors in the same city are scored live on compatibility, proximity, and urgency; the formula is shown on-screen for transparency.
Emergency Dispatch (simulated) — The top-ranked donor receives a simulated WhatsApp/SMS alert. If declined, the system automatically cascades to the next-ranked donor.
Live Logistics View — Once accepted, an auto-generated route is shown with an animated transport vehicle and simulated temperature telemetry.
Transparency Log — The completed allocation is recorded with a SHA-256 verification hash, proving it followed medical priority rather than favoritism.

Gamification — Donor Engagement Engine

Show Image

<details> <summary><strong>▸ Why gamification?</strong></summary>

Donor drop-off after a single donation is one of the biggest real-world problems for blood/organ networks. LifeLink counters this with:

Donor Levels (Bronze → Silver → Gold → Platinum Lifesaver)
Unlockable badges for milestones (e.g. "First Pledge", "Blood Hero x3", "Universal Donor")
City-wise leaderboard for friendly competition
Progress bars and micro-animations on every pledge/donation action

This is the platform's retention engine — it directly targets repeat engagement, not just one-time sign-ups.

Tech Stack
Layer	Technology	Why
Frontend	React + TypeScript	Component-based UI with type safety
Styling	Tailwind CSS	Fast, consistent styling and easy theming
Animation	Framer Motion	Live scoring counters, vehicle movement, badge unlocks
Auth & Database	Firebase (Auth + Firestore)	Serverless auth and real-time listeners power the live matching and logistics views
Maps	Google Maps JavaScript API	Real map rendering, distance calculation, route + vehicle simulation
Charts	Recharts	Reports and analytics visualizations
Verification	SHA-256 (Web Crypto API / crypto-js)	Real cryptographic hashing for the transparency log (not a distributed blockchain)
Icons	Lucide React	Consistent icon set

Note on simulated components: WhatsApp/SMS alerts and live GPS vehicle tracking are currently simulated in the UI rather than wired to real telemetry or messaging APIs (e.g. Twilio), since those require infrastructure and approvals beyond the initial build. The matching engine, hashing/verification, database, and map rendering are all fully real and functional. Wiring up real integrations here is one of the best first contributions — see Roadmap.

This structure is a recommended starting point — update it to match the actual repo once scaffolded.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Node.js v18 or higher
npm or yarn
A Firebase project (Auth + Firestore enabled)
A Google Maps API key with the Maps JavaScript API and Distance Matrix API enabled
Installation
bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd lifelink

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Copy the example environment file and fill in your keys
cp .env.example .env

# Start the development server
npm run dev

The app should now be running at http://localhost:5173 (or whichever port your dev server prints).

Environment Variables

Create a .env file in the project root with the following:

env
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_firebase_api_key
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_project.firebaseapp.com
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_project.appspot.com
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_sender_id
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id

VITE_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_google_maps_api_key

Never commit your .env file. .env.example should be kept in the repo with placeholder values for contributors.
